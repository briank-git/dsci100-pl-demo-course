        In the figure below, smoothness and area are two features of cancer cells that are being used to help diagnose if a tumor is Benign (blue) or Malignant (yellow). The diagnosis of the red point that is circled is unknown.

    <p>
        What do you expect to happen if we apply K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classification to the red point if  
        K = 3.

        The prediction will be malignant because visually, two of the three closest points are also malignant.

        It is challenging to tell, but the three points with the closest area will determine the prediction because the data have not been normalized.
